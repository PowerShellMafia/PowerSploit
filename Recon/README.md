## PowerView

PowerView is a PowerShell tool to gain network situational awareness on 
Windows domains. It contains a set of pure-PowerShell replacements for various 
windows "net *" commands, which utilize PowerShell AD hooks and underlying 
Win32 API functions to perform useful Windows domain functionality.

It also implements various useful metafunctions, including some custom-written 
user-hunting functions which will identify where on the network specific users 
are logged into. It can also check which machines on the domain the current 
user has local administrator access on. Several functions for the enumeration
and abuse of domain trusts also exist. See function descriptions for appropriate 
usage and available options. For detailed output of underlying functionality, pass 
the -Verbose or -Debug flags.

For functions that enumerate multiple machines, pass the -Verbose flag to get a
progress status as each host is enumerated. Most of the "meta" functions accept 
an array of hosts from the pipeline.
